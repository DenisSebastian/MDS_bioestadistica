            "abstract": "By Monte Carlo simulation, this study illustrates and summarizes the extent of robustness of the one-sample and two-sample Student t statistics for inferences on means to the assumptions of normality and/or equal variances when very small sample sizes are involved. It is determined that in a relative sense the two-sample t statistic is more robust to the assumption of normality than the one-sample statistic, if equal sample sizes are used. Whereas the robustness of the two-sample statistic is truly exceptional for both the normality and equal variance assumptions when n1 = n2, that of the one-sample statistic appears to be restricted to situations in which the underlined distribution is either symmetrical or only modestly skewed. The robustness of the two-sample statistic deteriorates considerably when the sample sizes differ by a factor of two or more. Therefore, the best protection available to a practitioner for the one-sample case is to use relatively large sample sizes, say around 25 to 30 observations, and to use equal sample sizes for the two-sample case.",
